        <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lahore">
            <p>Lahore's origins reach into antiquity. The city has been controlled by numerous 
            empires throughout the course of its history, including the Hindu Shahis, 
            Ghaznavids, Ghurids, and Delhi Sultanate by the medieval era. Lahore reached
             the height of its splendour under the Mughal Empire between the late 
             16th and early 18th century, and served as its capital city for a number of years.
              The city was captured by the forces of the Afsharid ruler Nader Shah in 1739, 
              and fell into a period of decay while being contested between the Afghans and 
              the Sikhs. Lahore eventually became capital of the Sikh Empire in the early 
              19th century, and regained some of its lost grandeur.</p>
